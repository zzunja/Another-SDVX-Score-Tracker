things left to do
- show total volforce somewhere ✔️
- add a state manager thing so that when you reload you dont have to re-import. everything would be saved locally ✔️
- add a way to see updated scores/see how much volforce you go up ✔️
- make the upload button not as ugly.
- make the stuff actually center correctly
- maybe add more filters?
- update website header and prob favicon (one day)
- add images per chart?
